# Brand Discovery

Read this file before preparing a PetGenesis run when the user provides a bare brand, company, product, or prospect name instead of a concrete mascot/avatar description or reference image.

## When To Run

Run a lightweight discovery worker before base generation when the request depends on brand cues. Skip discovery when the user already provides a concrete avatar description or reference images, unless they explicitly ask for brand research.

Prefer official sources such as the brand site, product pages, docs, about pages, press pages, or brand pages. Use reputable secondary sources only when official pages are too thin. Keep the search narrow: enough to extract visual and personality cues, not a market-research brief.

If web search is unavailable and the user gave only a bare brand name, ask for brand cues before generating.

## Worker Responsibilities

- search the web for 2-4 relevant sources, preferring official pages
- write an adaptive markdown brief rather than a rigid field dump
- cover identity/category, audience/use context, visual system, personality/tone, product/domain motifs, mascot translation cues, avoidances, and evidence/confidence
- mark mascot guidance that is inferred from sources as inference
- avoid copying logos, readable marks, UI screenshots, slogans, or text
- end with a compact `Generation handoff` section containing only `brand_name`, `brand_brief`, `avatar_seed`, `avoid`, and `brand_sources`
- do not generate images, prepare run folders, or edit unrelated files

## Discovery Worker Prompt

```text
Research a brand for PetGenesis mascot creation.

Brand/product/prospect: <brand name>
User context: <short user request>
Output file: <absolute path to brand-discovery.md>

Use web search. Prefer official brand, product, docs, about, press, or brand pages. Use reputable secondary sources only if official sources are too thin. Write an adaptive markdown brief to the output file. Headings may flex by brand, but the brief must cover:
- identity/category: canonical name, product type, what it does
- audience/use context: who it serves and where it appears
- visual system: palette, shapes, line quality, materials, typography feel, iconography, patterns
- personality/tone: emotional traits, energy, formality, playfulness
- product/domain motifs: objects, workflows, verbs, metaphors, environments
- mascot translation cues: candidate forms, signature traits, props, what must read at pet size
- avoidances: logos/text, trademark-sensitive elements, misleading cues, competitor confusion, poor mascot fits
- evidence/confidence: source URLs plus notes where evidence is weak or inferred

Do not copy logos, readable marks, UI screenshots, slogans, or text. Clearly label mascot guidance that is inferred rather than directly sourced.

End the brief with a `Generation handoff` section containing exactly:
- brand_name=<canonical brand/product name>
- brand_brief=<one sentence, max 45 words, covering palette/tone/domain motifs/personality>
- avatar_seed=<short mascot-safe visual idea, no logo copying>
- avoid=<short comma-separated list>
- brand_sources=<comma-separated source URLs>

Return exactly:
brand_discovery_file=<absolute output file path>
brand_name=<canonical brand/product name>
brand_brief=<same compact sentence from Generation handoff>
avatar_seed=<same short seed from Generation handoff>
avoid=<same short avoid list from Generation handoff>
brand_sources=<same comma-separated URLs from Generation handoff>
```

## Parent Handoff

Save the markdown brief before preparing the run. Pass it to `prepare_pet_run.py` as `--brand-discovery-file` together with `--brand-name`, `--brand-brief`, repeated `--brand-source`, and a concise `--pet-notes` value based on `avatar_seed` when the user did not provide a better avatar description.

Keep the full brief for review. Only the compact handoff fields should shape prompts.
